== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why my logo appears so big? =

If your logo appeears to be bigger than it needs to be, make sure to uncheck the "make logo responsive option" in settings

= Will extra stylesheets will be added even if I don't select any hover effect? =

Absolutely not. If you select no hover effect i.e 'none', sylesheets won't be added to your site. Similarly if you don't opt for the retina version of your logo retina.js will not be added.

= Can I use this plugin to insert other images in my website =

At the moment unfortunately no. I will be working on this in future upgrades
